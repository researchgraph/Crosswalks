ERA machine is source of infornation having an ODBC connection to IRMA

On the server chara.library.usyd.edu.au
CSV files are created by the shell script
runRdSwitchQueries.sh
which runs on a regular basis employing a set of SQL queries.
The queries are located in /home/dspace/rdswitchQueries and are run by 
a cron job.

Each query is named using the convention qry_<identifying keyword>.sh
The shell scripts run SQL programs drawing in information from the
IRMA and writing out CSV files named using the convention
<identifying keyword>.csv

The resulting CSV is then automatically pushed to the server 
rdswitchboard.library.usyd.edu.au:/home/dspace/  using ssh keys
as a secure method of transfer.

On rdswitchboard a Python program  writes XML from the CSV file

The identifying keyword is used to link the input CSV and the defined
XML syntax and the output XML. So for example

For example, an identifying keyword might be "Grants". CSV information relating to
grants is in the CSV file Grants.csv. The XML schema is to be located in
the file GrantsXMLSchemaInclude.py

The csv to xml conversion program is rdswitchcsv2xml.py and is run with
an argument rdswitchcsv2xml.py <identifying keyword> 
in this example

rdswitchcsv2xml.py Grants

The above program expects a schema file called
GrantsXMLSchemaInclude.py and an input csv file called Grants.csv.
The program will output an xml file called r.Grants.xml
