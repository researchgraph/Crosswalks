# Crosswalk from ORCID JSON/XML to Research Graph metamodel in CSV


The current crosswalk is updated for ORCID version 2.0 Schema.

* json-to-csv.sh: convert ORCID JSON to CSV
* xml-to-csv-summaries.py: convert ORCID XML Summaries to CSV. There are researcher records.
* xml-to-csv-activties.py: convert ORCID XML Actvities to CSV. There are publication/data records.

The old crosswalks are kept for future reference in the Archive folder.

## Archive
* generation-01: the first generation using XSLT and XML files
* generation-02: using JQ to map JSON to CSV, compatible with ORCID version 1.2 Schema.
